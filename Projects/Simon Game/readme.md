# SIMON GAME :recycle: :beginner:
Fun, interactive website that plays a game, beware, can keep you hooked to the screen for hours! :computer: :hourglass_flowing_sand:

The user can play the simon game by remembering the sequence of the button pressesthat the browser shows and upgrade to greater levels.:chart: :round_pushpin:

<br/>

### About The Project: 
It is a fun, interactive and simple project that lets user play a game where the browser randomly chooses and presses one of the four colored buttons and the player has to 
remember the sequence in which the buttons were pressed, one mistake and you lose! After the user replicates the exact sequence, the level is advanced, but the trick here 
is that the browser doesn't show its previous button presses and the user has to remember all of them in addition with the new press, so as to be able to clear the level.
