# Table Tag 
* Table tag is used to create tables in html.It's syntax is easy to remember.So let's jump into the syntax.
``` html
<!--Whenever you want to create a Table,you have to wrap the contents of Table into these Table tags.-->
<table>

</table>
```

* Now these are not the only tags you need to use there is a whole structure which you have to use.
``` html
<table>
  <tr>
   <th>Name</th>
   <th>Roll number</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Siddhi</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

So,first let's discuss what all these tags indicate.
* tr - This indicates table row.
* th - This indicates table heading
* td - This indicates Table data.
  
So in table you are going to fill everything rowwise,therefore we are wrapping our content in 'tr' tag.
Also many times we need a heading for our table, so for this we use th tag. Th tag basically makes our text bold so that we can differentiate  between heading and actual data.
And inorder to insert normal data we use td tag.So for every row there must be equal number of td or th tags.
In the above example, using html we have tried to make a table with name and roll number as heading and siddhi and 1 as table data.
